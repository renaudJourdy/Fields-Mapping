# Data Quality & Reliability

This section contains documentation for ensuring data quality, reliability, and integrity in the Fleeti Telemetry Mapping system.

## Purpose

The **Data Quality & Reliability** section provides:

- **Data Validation**: Schema validation, business rule validation, and data quality checks
- **Data Quality Monitoring**: Anomaly detection, data drift monitoring, and completeness checks
- **Data Lineage**: Tracking data flow, audit trails, and data provenance
- **Idempotency**: Handling duplicate packets and ensuring exactly-once semantics

**Target Audiences:**
- **Data Engineers**: Data quality monitoring and validation procedures
- **Operations Team**: Data quality alerts and troubleshooting
- **Developers**: Data validation patterns and idempotency handling
