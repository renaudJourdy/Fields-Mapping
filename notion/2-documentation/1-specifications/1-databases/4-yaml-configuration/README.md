**Status:** 🎯 Done

# Purpose

The YAML Configuration Database tracks generated YAML configuration files with versioning and provider-specific configurations. This database serves as the **single source of truth** for configuration file versions and deployment tracking.

**Important:** This database tracks the **OUTPUT** (generated configuration files), while the Mapping Fields Database tracks the **INPUT** (mapping rules used to generate configurations).

**Key Contents:** Generated YAML files per provider, semantic versioning, generation metadata, relations to mapping fields, deployment status tracking.

# Database Structure

## Column Definitions

Columns are listed in the same order as they appear in the CSV export:

| Column Name | Type | Required | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Config Name** | Title | ✅ Yes | Unique configuration identifier (primary key) | `navixy-v1.0.0` |
| **Change History** | Text | ❌ No | Description of changes in this version | `Location section only from Fleeti Fields (db)` |
| **Deployed To** | Text | ❌ No | Environment where config is deployed | `production`, `staging`, `development`, `not deployed` |
| **Deployment Date** | Date | ❌ No | When configuration was deployed | `2025-01-16 15:00:00` |
| **Generated By** | Person | ✅ Yes | Who generated the configuration | (Notion person) |
| **Generation Date** | Date | ✅ Yes | When configuration was generated | `December 17, 2025` |
| **Last Modified** | Date | ✅ Yes | Last modification date | `December 22, 2025 3:17 PM` |
| **Notes** | Text | ❌ No | Additional context | `Initial draft to iterate on.` |
| **Provider** | Select | ✅ Yes | Provider name | `navixy`, `oem-trackunit`, `oem-volvo` |
| **Status** | Select | ✅ Yes | Configuration status | `active`, `deprecated`, `pending` |
| **Version** | Text | ✅ Yes | Semantic version | `1.0.0`, `1.0.1`, `1.0.6` |
| **YAML Content** | Text/File | ✅ Yes | Generated YAML configuration content | `navixy-mapping.yaml` |
| **💽 Mapping Fields (db)** | Relation | ✅ Yes | Links to Mapping Fields used in generation | (Relation) |

## Primary Key

**Config Name** serves as the primary key. Should be unique and follow format: `{provider}-v{version}` (e.g., `navixy-v1.0.0`, `oem-trackunit-v2.1.0`).

**Important:** The combination of **Provider** + **Version** must be unique. Each provider can have multiple versions, but each version must be unique per provider.

## Validation Rules

- **Config Name**: Must be unique and follow format `{provider}-v{version}`
- **Provider + Version**: Must be unique combination
- **Version**: Should follow semantic versioning (e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.0.1`, `1.0.6`)
- **YAML Content**: Must be valid YAML syntax (can be filename reference or full content)
- **Status**: Values are `active`, `deprecated`, `pending`

# How to Use

- Track generated YAML configuration files with versioning
- Manage configuration deployment and rollback
- Identify which mapping rules are included in each configuration version
- Audit configuration changes and deployment history

**Workflow:** Generate configuration from Mapping Fields Database → Review and validate → Deploy to environment → Track changes and lifecycle

# YAML Generation Specification

YAML configurations are generated from the Mapping Fields Database using the `generate_yaml_from_csv.py` script. The script reads `Computation Structure JSON` from Mapping Fields and generates optimized YAML following the specification in `yaml-mapping-reference.yaml`.

## Key Concepts

**Field Name vs Field Path**: YAML uses **Field Names** (stable identifiers like `location_latitude`) as keys, not **Field Paths** (can change like `location.latitude`). Backend resolves Field Names to Field Paths at runtime.

**Mapping Types**: `direct`, `prioritized`, `calculated`, `transformed`, `io_mapped`, `mix` - each generates different YAML structure.

**Parameter Types** (for calculated fields):
- `provider:` - References provider telemetry fields
- `fleeti:` - References other Fleeti fields (dependencies)
- `static:` - Constant values (bit positions, thresholds, etc.)

## YAML Mapping Reference

The **`yaml-mapping-reference.yaml`** file is the authoritative specification for YAML structure. It contains:

- **8 Optimization Rules**: Rules for minimizing redundancy while maintaining clarity
- **Parameter Types**: Complete documentation of provider, fleeti, and static parameters
- **Mapping Type Examples**: Detailed examples for all mapping types (direct, prioritized, calculated, transformed, io_mapped)
- **Backend Processing Details**: How each mapping type is processed by the backend

**Location:** `yaml-mapping-reference.yaml` in this directory

**Usage:** Refer to this file when:
- Understanding YAML structure requirements
- Writing or modifying YAML generation scripts
- Debugging YAML configuration issues
- Implementing backend YAML parsing logic
